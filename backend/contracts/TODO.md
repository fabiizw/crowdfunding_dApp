### 1 (Peter)
 Add User Factory Pattern just like the ProjectFactory and Project contracts
 It should allow to create User with attributes like name, age, adress
 Also make sure that these changes are integrated in ProjectFactory.sol and Project.sol meaning that each project should store the user who created this project
 Make sure to assign an adress to the user (off chain computation)

### 2 (Fabi)
create the endpoints and off chain computational components in APP.js

### 3 (Will)
Integrate IPFS (if its works) and see what data to store off chain 

### 4 (Zhichao)
Add additional computational elements using the off chain data maybe
Add new endpoints for metrics like total number of projects, total number of users, ...

### 5 (Sean)
Write unit tests for the functions in the smart contracts/ for the endpoints

### DEADLINE 
Try to finish these task until Sunday 21.7
